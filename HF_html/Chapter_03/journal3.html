		<h1> Segway'n USA </h1>
		<p>
		Documenting my trip around the US on my very own Sehway!

		Well I made it 1200 miles alredy, and I passed
		through some interesting places on the way: 
		</p>
		<ol>
		<li>Walla Walla, WA</li>
		<li>Magic City, ID</li>
		<li>Bountiful, UT</li>
		<li>Last Chance, CO</li>
		<li>Truth or Consequences, NM.</li>
		<li>Why, AZ</li>
		</ol>

		<h2> July 14, 2005 </h2>
		<p>
		I saw some Burma Shave style signs on the side of the
		road today:
		</p>
		<blockquote>	
		Passing cars,<br>
		When you can't see,<br>
		May get you,<br>
		a glimpse,<br>
		Of eternity.<br>
		</blockquote>	
		<p>
		I definitely won't be passing any cars.
		</p>

		<h2> June 2, 2005 </h2>

		<p>
		My first day of the trip! I can't believe I finally got
		everything packed and ready to go. Because I'm on a Segway,
		I wasn't able to bring a whole lot with me:
		<ul>
		<li>cell phone</li>
		<li>ipod</li>
		<li>digital camera</li>
		<li>a protein bar.</li>
		</ul>
		Just the essentials. As
		Lao Tzu would have said, <q>A journey of a thousand miles begins
		with one Segway.</q>
