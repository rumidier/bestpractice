  Onew of the first presentation-specific HTML elements was font,
  and it's also one of the older HTML elements you still find, all
  too frequently, in web pages. It's not surprising that font and
  text properties were of such interset in building web pages. Few
  changes you can make to an element's style attributes can have
  such an effect as changing the text or font properties. </p>
  <p>
  Notice I say text or font properties. The font has to do with the
  characters themselves: their family, size, type, and other
  elements of the characters' appearance. The text attributes,
  though, have more to do with decoration attached to the text and
  include text decoration, alignment, and so on.
