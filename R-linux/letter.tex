\opening{Dear Mr. O'Reilly,}

I would like to comment on the \LeTeX\ example as presented in
Chapter~20 of {\em Running Linux}. Although it was a valiant effort,
I find that the example falls somewhat short of what
one might expect in a discussion of text-formatting systems.
In a future edition of the book, I suggest that you replace
the example with one that is more instructive.

\closing{Thank you}
